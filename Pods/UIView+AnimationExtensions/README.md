##UIView Animation Extensions 

A **useful** category on `UIView` containing a set of most commonly used animations like rotation or flip and others.

It is designed to be **as easy to use as possible to integrate and use** to speed up everyday development tasks. All the methods are well documented and described. 

Furthermore, the category comes along with **a small demo project** where you can see the animations in action. Current version of the category includes following animations:

 - Rotation
 - Flip
 - Horizontal Shake
 - Vertical Shake
 - Motion Effects
 - Pulse
